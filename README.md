# Payvance

Payvance is an advanced financial system that provides businesses with a custom payment infrastructure, enabling them to control, process, and manage payments in a more flexible and independent manner. Instead of relying on third-party payment providers like Razorpay, Stripe, or Paytm, Payvance allows companies to own and operate their payment processing system.

Unlike traditional payment gateways, Payvance serves two primary use cases:

- **Complete Payment System for Businesses** – Companies can adopt Payvance as their full payment infrastructure, integrating it into their operations without needing to build their own solution.  
- **Standalone Payment Gateway** – Businesses that only need a payment gateway can use Payvance as a secure and efficient solution, just like they would with third-party providers.

Built with a focus on the e-commerce sector, Payvance is designed to support various business models, including B2B, D2C, and beyond. The system is not just a personal project but a real-world, industry-standard solution, ensuring it remains practical and valuable beyond a showcase, allowing companies to adopt it directly or customize it to their specific needs.
